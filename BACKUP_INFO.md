# Summer Learning Adventure 2025 - Backup Information

A backup of the current working version (as of June 2, 2025) has been created at:
`/Users/jnarayanassamy/Janar/personel/kids/kidssummerplan2025_backup_june2/`

## Why Create a Backup?

This backup preserves the current working state of the application after removing the Calendar View and Daily Tasks sections. If any issues arise with future improvements, you can revert to this known working version.

## What's Included in the Backup?

- All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- All assets and resources
- Configuration files
- A BACKUP_INFO.md file with details about the backup
- A dedicated launch_backup.sh script to test the backup version

## How to Use the Backup

If you need to restore the application to this version:

1. Navigate to the backup directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jnarayanassamy/Janar/personel/kids/kidssummerplan2025_backup_june2
   ```

2. Copy all files back to the main application directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r * /Users/jnarayanassamy/Janar/personel/kids/kidssummerplan2025/
   ```

3. Or simply run the backup version to verify it works:
   ```bash
   ./launch_backup.sh
   ```

## Current Application State

The current version of the application includes:
- Weekly Tasks view
- Progress tracking
- Child selection between Sanha and Sanav
- Week navigation (1-8)
- Task completion tracking
- Progress visualization

The Calendar View and Daily Tasks sections have been removed as requested.
